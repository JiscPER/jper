# e.g. same owner as the one that is going to be running the script would be good
# ensure this script is executable can be run as sudo without password by the software
# by doing visudo and adding this script to the commands that can be run without password, like:
# mark ALL = (root) NOPASSWD:/home/mark/jper/src/jper/service/models/moveFTPfiles.sh

# TODO: could add a check for the username to see if matching user is logged in, by calling the w command
# in which case do nothing on this iteration because the user is probably in the process of sending files

# for time being copy everything to an ftp archive for this user first
# so there is an original copy of everything received before processing by the system
