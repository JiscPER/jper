"""
This module contains all the Data Access Objects for models which are persisted to Elasticsearch
at some point in their lifecycle.

Each DAO is an extension of the octopus ESDAO utility class which provides all of the ES-level heavy lifting,
so these DAOs mostly just provide information on where to persist the data, and some additional storage-layer
query methods as required
