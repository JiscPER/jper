		<h2>How it works</h2>
		<p>The Publications Router enables publishers to automatically deposit publications in corresponding Open Access repositories. Publishers send metadata for publicatons to the Publications Router which then checks their embargo period and finds corresponding repositories. Publications which can be made freely available after the end of their embargo period and can be linked to an institutions are then requested from the publishers and delivered to the repository. </p>
		<p><img src="/static/xxx" alt="Visual Description of the Router"></p>

		<p>The JISC Publications Router provides the following interfaces for delivering metadata and the full text:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><b>SWORD2</b>: according to the SWORD V2 service document (here: NISO JATS and PDF/WORD),</li>
			<li><b>FTP</b>: JATS-XML for metadata, plus zip-files for full text and other files</li>
			<li><b>Publicatons Router API</b>: specific JSON structure.</li>

		</ul>

		<p>The DeepGreen Router will slightly adjust the transfer to fit German conditions. Further information will follow.</p>

		<p>The publications are assigned to institutions with indicators that should be included in the metadata: name of the institution with postcode(s), author name(s) with ORCID if available, email adress of the author, etc.</p> 

		<p>The institutions only receive publications at the end of their embargo period, and are obligated to respect any other license regulations which ensures complete compliance with publishers' licenses terms.</p>
