		<h2>How it works</h2>
		<p>The Publications Router provides a simple delivery of publications into repositories. Publishers deliver the metadata and publications at the end of their embargo period to the router from where they can be received.</p>
		<p><img src="/static/xxxx" alt="Visual Description of the Router"></p>
		<p>The JISC Publications Router provides the following interfaces for receiving meatadata and the full text:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>SWORD2</b>: Notifications are delivered directly from the router (the SWORD-client) to repositories with SWORD deposits,</li>
			<li><b>OAI-PMH</b>: Notifications are provided by the router and can be picked up by the repositories,</li>
			<li><b>Publication Router API</b>: Notifications are provided by the router and can be picked up using REST</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The DeepGreen Router will probably slightly adjust the transfer to fit German conditions. </p>
		<p>Publications are assigned to the institutions using indicators that are provided upon registration. These can include the ORCID of researchers, the name of the institutions and the postecode(s) and the email domain name. To use the SWORD2 interface the institution has to provide their username and password during registration</p>
