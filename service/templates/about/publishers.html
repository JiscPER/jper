		<h1>For Publishers</h1>

		<h2>Benefits</h2>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Confidence that their documents are being used according to their license agreements</li>
				<li> Supporting the Green Way of Open Access</li>
				<li> Help institutions accurately capture and respect your licensing terms, including any embargo periods.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h2>How to join</h2>
		<p>Please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@deepgreen.org">info@oa-deepgreen.org</a> if you would like to find out more.</p> Please note that DeepGreen will not create one account for each publisher but one account for each alliance license contract. If a publisher is part of more than one contract, they will receive more than one account. 

		<h2>How it works</h2>
		<p>The Publications Router enables publishers to automatically deposit publications in corresponding Open Access repositories. Publishers send publications and their metadata to the Publications Router which then finds corresponding repositories and notifies them about the publication. </p>
		

		<p>The  Publications Router provides the following interfaces for delivering metadata and the full text:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><b>SWORD2</b>: according to the SWORD V2 service document (here: NISO JATS and PDF/WORD),</li>
			<li><b>FTP</b>: JATS-XML for metadata, plus zip-files for full text and other files</li>
			<li><b>Publicatons Router API</b>: specific JSON structure.</li>

		</ul>

		<p>Next to the basic transfer functions of JISC Publications Router, DeepGreen will adjust these to fit German conditions.</p>

		<p>The publications are assigned to institutions with affiliation indicators that should be included in the metadata: name of the institution, author name(s) with ORCID if available, email adress of the author(s), etc.</p> 

		<p>The institutions are obligated to respect any embargo periods and other license regulations.</p>
