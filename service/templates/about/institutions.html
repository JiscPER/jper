		<h2>How it works</h2>
		<p>The Publications Router provides a simple delivery of publications into repositories. Publishers deliver publications and their metadata to DeepGreen from where they can be received.</p>
		
		<p>The Publications Router provides the following interfaces for receiving meatadata and the full text:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>SWORD2</b>: Notifications are delivered directly from the router (the SWORD-client) to repositories with SWORD deposits</li>
			<li><b>OAI-PMH</b>: Notifications are provided by the router and can be picked up by the repositories</li>
			<li><b>Publication Router API</b>: Notifications are provided by the router and can be picked up using REST</li>
		</ul>
		<p>On top of the basic transfer functions of the JISC Publications Router, DeepGreen will adapt its functionality to fully comply with the complex Open-Access rights in Germany.</p>
		<p>Publications are assigned to the institutions using indicators that are provided upon registration. These can include the ORCID of researchers, the name of the institutions and the email domain name. To use the SWORD2 interface the institution has to provide their username and password during registration.</p>
