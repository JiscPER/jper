"The Project Deep Green aims to transfer scientific publications, which "
"can be made freely available at the end of their embargo period, into "
"Open Acess repositories. The focus over the next two years will be on "
"licenses which are funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) "
"and have been negotiated nationwide. These licenses are called Allianz-"
"Lizenzen, and they contain special Open-Access regulations."

"The experience gathered from Allianz license agreements since 2011 shows,"
" that the circle of authorized authors (or their instiutional "
"representatives) hardly ever make use of these Open Access rights. In a "
"span of 2 years the projects aims to make the agreed upon Open Access "
"condition easy to use on a technical level and if possible to make them "
"automatic. Which would enable publishers to deliver these publications "
"periodically through defined interfaces to Open Access repositories, "
"rather than having authors or the authorized libraries put them in "
"manually."

"During the 2 year project phase, the goal is to make these agreed upon "
"Open Access regulations comfortable on a technical level and if possible "
"automatize them. Authors or the authorized libraries would then no longer"
" be responsible of transfering publications into Ope Access repositories,"
" instead publishers would deliver them periodically through a defined "
"interface. For this the project partners will build a technical platform "
"as a data hub: participating publishers transfer the publications and "
"metadata through the interface and authorized institutional or subject "
"repositories receive the data. The publishers Karger and SAGE are pilot "
"partners for the project."
